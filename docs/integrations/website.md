# Website

eesel AI can use your website pages as a source of knowledge.  It's a great way to test, and provide context about your company for the bot to use as general knowldge.&#x20;

You can also crawl specific pathways of your website, like an FAQ or Product section, to enable the bot to have knowledge of more specific information that's available on your site.&#x20;

eesel AI can also provide links to your website pages as part of its responses, by simply prompting it to do so.&#x20;

There are two ways to add your website as a source for the bot:&#x20;

1. Using our website crawler
2. Using our browser extension



## Website crawler

To use the website crawler, simply:

1. **Login** to your eesel AI account, **select** the bot you want to train
2. Click **Integrations > Website**
3. Add your website **URL**
   1. Optional: specify which URL paths to include or exclude
4. Wait for the crawler to index your pages!
5. **Review** the links by clicking on your website under the integrations sidebar on the left.



## Browser extension

To use the [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eesel-ai-chatgpt-sidebar/ejhkkbilnpifailgngpkgmiofhioacjd?hl=en) to index specific public pages, or index private pages:

1. **Download** our browser extension
2. **Login** to your eesel AI account and select your bot from the extension's bot dropdown
3. **Navigate** to the pages you want to add
4. **Open** the extension and select **Sources > Add current tab** or add all tabs.

Your pages will appear in the eesel dashboard on the sidebar instantly for use!



## Common Troubleshooting Tips

If you're having trouble crawling your site, here are some tips:

* Ensure that you've entered the correct URL
* Double check any excluded or included pathways
* If attempting to use the crawler, ensure that it's a publicly accessible site.
  * If it's still not crawling despite public then try to add the sitemap to the crawler instead
* If there's a large volume of pages, sometimes it can take time for the dashboard to catch up.

If you are still experiencing any issues, please reach out to support.&#x20;

**Note**: Trial users do have crawl limits, so use the extension to be selective about what pages you want to use for testing.
