# PDFs

Training on PDFs is very simple. You can transform other document types, like Word files etc, to PDFs and then add them to your bot. You can upload them directly to eesel AI

2. Click **PDF**
3. Click **upload files**, select and upload your PDFs. It will be supported up to 25 MB

The bot won’t read images by default, so make sure the content is in text format

Your files will help the bot get smarter and more helpful. You’re one step closer to smoother support.
