# Sharepoint

At the moment, our Sharepoint integration is not available as a default integration.&#x20;

We can set up an integration on a Custom Plan upon request, depending on the way your Sharepoint is structured.&#x20;

However, you _can_ [upload individual PDFs](pdfs.md) to eesel AI if that's what your Sharepoint contains.&#x20;

If you want to discuss a Sharepoint integration, please note it will not be available to trial and will require a Custom Plan. When reaching out to discuss, please make sure you include information about your Sharepoint stucture/files in order to help us confirm what we can support.&#x20;

Thanks!
