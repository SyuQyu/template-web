# YouTube

To add YouTube videos as a source of knowledge for the bot, you must be on a paid Business Plan (unavailable in the trial).&#x20;

The process of adding YouTube videos as knowledge enables the bot to create transcripts of the videos, and these transcripts are what the bot uses to help answer questions.&#x20;

You can also give the bot knowledge of YouTube video URLs to be use in its responses. For example, add an [article](../#what-are-articles-how-do-i-use-them) that contains the name/description of the video, and the URL. Then, add to the [prompt](../getting-started/prompt-and-actions.md) that the AI should always link the relevant YouTube video URL in its responses.
