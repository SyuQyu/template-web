## Create a Intercom AI Agent

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Intercom Agent.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

eesel can automate your frontline support as an AI agent inside Intercom. You can have it leave internal notes, automatically reply, and triage tickets.

Once your AI has been trained and customized, it's time to link your Intercom domain to your AI bot.

To set up eesel as an AI agent inside Intercom, see our [AI Agent guide](../products/ai-agent.md).

## Create a Intercom AI Copilot

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Intercom Copilot.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Check out our [setup guide](../products/ai-copilot.md) for using AI Copilot in your Intercom.

eesel AI can act as an AI copilot for your Intercom by using our [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eesel-ai-chatgpt-sidebar/ejhkkbilnpifailgngpkgmiofhioacjd?hl=en).&#x20;

The AI can automatically pick up on the content of a ticket, and generate a response based on the knowledge it has access to.

You can use the browser extension to select the bot you want to use for its answer, and then draft a response and chat with the bot to edit before you paste is as a reply.

## Intercom Actions

Once you've trained the bot and integrated it with your Intercom, it's important to customize it and add actions so that you can get the most out of your AI and automate manual tasks.

The following are Intercom specific actions. You can use them in combination with other actions on different platforms as well.

<details>

<summary>Tag conversation</summary>

`intercom_tag_conversation`

* **Purpose:** Add tags to an Intercom conversation.
* **Key Params:** `tag: str`
* **When/How to Use:** Similar to `zendesk_tag_ticket`. Use for categorization, reporting, or triggering workflows based on conversation topics. Note that this tool takes a single string `tag`. The conversation ID is automatically available.
*   **Example Prompt Instruction:**

    > Upon successfully answering a user's question about feature usage, you must call intercom\_tag\_conversation. Set the tag parameter to 'feature-inquiry'. If the user was asking about a known issue, make a separate call to intercom\_tag\_conversation with the tag 'known-issue'.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Close conversation</summary>

`intercom_close_conversation`

* **Purpose:** Close an Intercom thread after a short delay (\~30 seconds).
* **Key Params:** â€” (No explicit parameters)
* **When/How to Use:** Similar to `zendesk_close_ticket`. Use when the conversation is resolved and no further action is needed. The approximately 30-second delay is built-in. The conversation ID is automatically available.
*   **Example Prompt Instruction:**

    > If the user confirms their issue is resolved and expresses satisfaction, or if the conversation has been inactive for several minutes after you provided a solution, you must call intercom\_close\_conversation to close the thread after the standard delay.

</details>

<summary>Leave internal note</summary>

`intercom_leave_internal_note`

* **Purpose:** Leaves an internal note on the ticket.
* **Key Params:** `note: str`

*   **Example Prompt Instruction:**

    > If you escalate a conversation to a human agent, or if you need to summarize the AI's actions for the next agent, call intercom\_leave\_internal\_note. The note parameter should contain the summary. For urgent escalations that need specific attention, you can also include notify\_emails=\['agent1@example.com', 'manager@example.com'] to alert specific team members.

<summary>Assign conversation (escalation)</summary>

`intercom_assign_conversation`

Define how the AI determines the appropriate `assignee_id`. This parameter requires the Intercom ID for the admin or team, not an email address. The conversation ID is automatically available.
*   **Example Prompt Instruction:**

    > If the user asks a question about their billing history or requires an action related to their subscription, you must inform them you are escalating their request to the billing team and call intercom\_assign\_conversation.

You must specify the field names (standard or custom field IDs as strings) you need. The ticket ID is automatically available.
*   **Example Prompt Instruction:**

    > Before escalating a ticket, you should check its current status and assignee. Call intercom\_get\_ticket\_fields with the parameter fields='status,assignee\_id'. Use the results to inform the user about the current state or to decide who to assign it to next.
    >
