eesel AI instantly plugs into your Front, learns from your past emails, macros, help center and more, and seamlessly joins in like a new teammate.

### Connect your Front

If Front is not already connected, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the [eesel AI dashboard](https://dashboard.eesel.ai/)
2. Click the "+" icon in the sidebar next to Integrations
3. Locate "Front" and open up that integration
4. Click "Start setup".

Once you have authenticated with Front, you should see it connected. The next step is to teach the AI Agent some knowledge!

### Teaching your AI Agent

Once Front is connected, it should be provided some knowledge. This can be done by adding websites, uploading PDFs, or training the bot on public help centers.&#x20;

All of these options can be easily configured from the Integrations page as well, where there are hundreds of options to choose from depending on where your material can be founded.

Alternatively, you can create **Articles** that the bot can use as knowledge too.

### Activating the AI Agent

To enable your AI to start drafting replies and responding to inbound emails, you should click "AI Agent" under "Front" in the sidebar on the dashboard.

There you will find the appropriate settings to set the AI Agent live
