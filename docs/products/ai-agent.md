# AI Agent

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/AI_Agent_Asset_2 1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

eesel AI plugs into Zendesk, Freshdesk, Jira or other help desk tools, learns from your past replies and other docs, and starts handling your frontline support. You can:

* Automatically handle frontline support
* Take actions across your platforms to automate your workflow
* Escalate to your agents&#x20;

You can check out each integration [here](broken-reference).

## Setting up AI Agent

1. **Create** an eesel AI account
2. **Create an AI bot** and start training it on your knowledge
   1. Add your help center, Confluence pages, website, and more
3. Connect your **help desk domain**
   1. Optional: [train on past tickets](../#id-like-more-information-about-past-ticket-training)
4. Test and customize the [prompt](../getting-started/prompt-and-actions.md) in the "chat" tab.
5. Add [actions](../getting-started/prompt-and-actions.md) to enable your bot to automate more than just replies
   1. We recommend adding an 'assign ticket' action for escalations as a good starting point.&#x20;
6. Click your **helpdesk integration** in the left sidebar > **AI agent**
7. Click **"Leave public replies"** and click **"live"** when you're ready for it to respond.



By default, eesel AI will automatically respond to all incoming tickets. Some helpdesks allow for trigger and condition changes to alter the tickets eesel responds to, but for more guidance about how to do this please reach out to hi@eesel.app or our in-app support channel.
