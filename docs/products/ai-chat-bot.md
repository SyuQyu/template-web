## What is an AI chat bot?

eesel AI can be added as a chat bot to your website, help center or other pages in different ways. It is a useful chat bot that helps to answer queries based on the knowledge you train it on.&#x20;

You can customize it to answer in certain ways, create tickets in certain circumstances, deflect questions, escalate, and more.&#x20;

An AI chatbot is useful for:&#x20;

* Ecommerce sales and product inquiries
* Self-service of order inquiries or other questions from customers
* As a guide for your help center and support questions

## What different ways can you implement an AI chat bot?

eesel AI has our own options for creating a new chat bot for your sites:

1. **Chat bubble**
   1. This is a simple code snippet you can configure to add eesel to your site or help center.
2. **Chat inline**
   1. This is an embedded version of the chat bot that you can add to your site.

Some helpdesk also have their own version of a chatbot/widget that you may be able to integrate eesel AI with. For example, [Zendesk's messaging widget](../integrations/zendesk/zendesk-messaging-widget-integration.md). For help integrating with an existing widget, reach out to support.

## &#x20;How to set up and customize your chat bubble



1. Log in to your eesel AI dashboard.
2. Choose a bot you want to power your chat bubble.
3. Add knowledge sources such as URLs, Google Drive folders, or Notion pages. The AI will use these to find answers.
4. Navigate to the Integrations tab and search for Chat Bubble.
5. Select Chat Bubble and begin setup.
6. Configure appearance and behaviour :
   * Write clear instructions for how the AI should respond.
   * Select a tone (e.g., friendly, formal).
   * Set a welcome message (e.g., “Hi there! How can I help you today?”).
   * Add a title that appears on top of the bubble (e.g., AI Support Agent).
   * Paste a logo or avatar image URL.
   * Use the colour picker to match your brand’s colours.
   * Toggle branding if you prefer not to display the eesel logo.
   * Add up to three suggested questions to guide users.
     * Example:
       * Where’s my order?
       * What’s your return policy?
       * How do I track my package?
7. Preview the chat bubble to make sure everything looks and works as expected.
8. Please copy the code snippet and paste it into the `<body>` tag of your website.
9. Test the bot right from the dashboard before publishing live.

### Tips

* Use clear instructions for tone and role:\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample_: “Respond concisely, stay friendly, and answer only based on verified sources.”
* Include a transparent and easy way for customers to escalate. (See [Broken link](broken-reference "mention"))

**Important Notes**

* You need an active eesel AI account to access chat bubble setup.
* Some customization options like branding removal may depend on your subscription tier.
* Ensure your sources are well-structured and up to date to provide accurate responses.
* For issues with embedding or design compatibility, reach out to eesel support for assistance.
