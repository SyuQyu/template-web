With eesel AI, you can set up an AI bot that is trained on your internal documentation and designed for your team.

In most instances, companies like to have some public/customer facing bots, and have a separate bot for their internal teams. This way, you can have each bot trained, prompted, and designed specifically for your employees while keeping everything for your customers completely separate.

Internal chat AI is great for:&#x20;

* Onboarding new employees
* Finding company documentation, policies or procedures instantly
* Streamlining support, sales, HR, or other teams in their workflows&#x20;

At the moment, we currently have integrations for:&#x20;

* [Slack](../integrations/slack.md)
* [Teams](../integrations/teams.md)

eesel AI is added as an app to your workspace, and can be @ mentioned in channels or privately messaged. The responses are based on the way you train your AI bot.&#x20;

Multiple bots can be added to different channels. For more information, visit each help page for [Slack](../integrations/slack.md) and [Teams](../integrations/teams.md) and reach out if you need more guidance, either via our support chat or hi@eesel.app.
