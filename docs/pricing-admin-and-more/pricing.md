# Pricing

## Plans

Please see our [pricing page](https://www.eesel.ai/pricing) for more details. We have three plans to choose from:&#x20;

<h3 align="center">Team Plan - $299/mo </h3>

The Team plan is ideal for small teams who are looking for a Copilot solution trained on their website or wiki Docs. You can plug eesel into your Slack, create up to 3 bots, and have 1,000 interactions per month.&#x20;

This plan does not include automatic replies to tickets or triaging actions.

<h3 align="center">Business Plan - $799/mo</h3>

The Business Plan is our most popular plan and contains everything from the Team plan but also automatic replies, internal notes, and triaging inside helpdesks. It also includes unlimited bots, and greater integration and training options. You're also provided up to 3,000 interactions per month.&#x20;

This plan is best for teams who want an AI Agent in their helpdesk, or deeper integrations across multiple platforms like Shopify actions.

<h3 align="center">Custom Plan</h3>

A Custom Plan is priced around what _you_ need. For example, if you need more interactions, or want to set up an integration with a custom platform or one that's not available by default.&#x20;

Custom Plan quotes are prepared based on what you're looking for. For a Custom Plan quote, please prepare a detailed description about what actions, integrations, and usage you're looking for and let the team know at hi@eesel.app.&#x20;

#### We also have our Annual plan, and when you choose it, you'll enjoy a 20% savings every month on all our prices. We're thrilled to offer this fantastic deal to help you make the most of our services!&#x20;

This is best for teams who want a quick start with more complex setups and dedicated time from our engineers for prompt and actions assistance.



## Interactions

Interactions are defined as any reply or action the bot takes. Actions are defined in the Customize tab.

For example, if a conversation has multiple messages back and forth between the customer and the bot, each **reply from the bot** is considered an interaction. If during the conversation the bot needs to take an action like looking up order information on Shopify (an action as defined in the Customize tab), then that action will also be considered an interaction.

There are a set amount of interactions available by default on each plan. We know it can be hard to judge whether you may be under or over the default available interactions, so we offer a grace period for the first month of your plan to determine what your usage looks like moving forward.

If you go over your usage, you will receive a notification to contact support. There, we will assess your usage and price your plan based on that. Generally, we price based on 15c per interaction, with options for discounts in bulk interaction purchases.

**Seasonal usage spike** can also be a common occurrence, so we can adjust and charge based on what you expect. We're also looking into PAYG pricing, but at this time have not released this option yet. If you're interested in PAYG pricing, feel free to let us know so we can determine the best way to provide pricing options for our customers.
