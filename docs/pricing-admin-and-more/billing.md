You can update your billing details through the Stripe dashboard link via Settings > Billing.

### How to Unsubscribe /Cancel plan

1. Heading to your dashboard&#x20;
2. Click Settings (you can find it in a drop-down in the top left corner)
3. Choose the billing menu
4. Choose "View Stripe Dashboard"&#x20;

**Notes :** \
If you're on a trial account, we won’t ask for any payment details during that time. You’ll only be charged if you decide to upgrade to a paid plan later on

You can contact support if you need any help regarding the cancellation, request changes for admin billing, request invoices using company details, and much more! We will be happy to assist you.
