## EU Data Residency

Weâ€™ve updated our policy to host data exclusively on EU servers upon request and our subprocessors, OpenAI and Pinecone, are SOC2 Type II certified for robust data security.

Please let us know if you want to be hosted on EU servers.

## Storing and processing data

The data you provide access to is securely stored in a SOC2 Type II certified vector database in the form of embeddings (mathematical representations). These embeddings are crucial for the app to answer questions.

When a request is made, the app uses the embeddings to find related pages and conversations, and shares only specific relevant snippets with OpenAI to generate the response.
